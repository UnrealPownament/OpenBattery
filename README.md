# OpenBattery üîã
This Repository will collect data and informations about the development of open-source battery packs, with a focus on smartphone ones.
The data collected will have both practical and didactical purposes, as the ultimate goal is to collect the knowledge to develop battery packs from scratch.

At the moment, i'm focused on building a Fairphone 4 Battery pack, based on the 18650/21700 Lithium Cells.

## Why should anyone ever need such Fat-Phone in their pocket?
One of the biggest issues about mobiles batteries, is that most of the devices have their own form-factor and pin-out. 
This implies that batteries cannot be swapped between different devices. Which is not a very sustainable concept, given the humongous usage of Lithium we are making. 
For such reason i personally think that we should try to standardize our batteries form factors AMAP, in order to avoid waste and reduce costs. 

Since the 18650/21700 cells are making their way into the Automotive world, I personally think that their cost will tend to drop respect to other form factor cells. As a plus, Cylindrical cells come with their own metal case, wich makes them much less delicate than pouch ones, and therefore safer.

In the end, a 21700 Lithium Cells battery pack, in 1s2p configuration, will easily provide 4.2V, 8000 mAh, which will make you forget about having a power-bank with you. And if ever needed, you can still have a couple of emergency cells in your backpack to swap them.

## How You can help
As previously mentioned, this repository will collect both practical, and didactical informations about the project. So anyone can participate in the forum. You can both share your doubts, your experimental results, or discuss about your ideas.
